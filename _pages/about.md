# About me

I spent years in academic research studying biophysics: how proteins fold, how biological systems behave, the fundamental mechanics behind life itself. It was fascinating work, but after a while I realized something: I needed to see my work have tangible impact. In academia, you can spend years on a single question with no guarantee you'll ever find an answer. I wanted to work on problems where I could see results, where what I did actually mattered to people.

So I made the jump to data science.

My path into biophysics was a bit unusual. As a physics student, I took a statistical mechanics course that was taught so poorly I was furious, but when I studied it on my own I found it beautiful and powerful. That tension between inspiration and frustration drew me deeper into the subject, eventually leading me to apply it to biological systems. (Fun fact: I originally wanted to work in astrophysics, but after being unable to find an advisor, I discovered I actually hated the field. Sometimes things work out.)

## What I Do Now

At VeryCoolCompany, I work on understanding customer behavior and building data-driven solutions for marketing challenges. I do exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, propensity modeling, and econometric analysis to help companies make better decisions about their audiences.

One project I'm particularly proud of: I'm completely redesigning how we create audience insights for clients. Traditionally, these reports were manual, time-consuming, and only used one data source at a time. I built a system that integrates multiple data sources (attitudinal surveys, brand perception, behavioral data, location data) and uses LLMs to automatically generate insights from massive datasets that would otherwise be overwhelming to navigate.

The really interesting part was solving the hallucination problem: I found a way to essentially eliminate false information from the LLM outputs, which was critical for client-facing work. The system I built (using Streamlit, since standard tools like Tableau couldn't handle what we needed) includes an interactive chat interface where users can ask any question about the data and get accurate answers. When we showed it to our CEO and potential clients, the feedback was overwhelmingly enthusiastic.

## What Drives Me

I love approaching problems like puzzles: figuring out what data we need, what relationships matter, how to get from question to answer. But it's not enough for me to solve interesting technical challenges; I need to know my work matters. If nobody cares about what I'm building, I'm not motivated.

One unexpected perk of working in marketing: I get to learn a ton of random facts about how people think and behave. As someone who's naturally curious (I read voraciously, and Italo Calvino is my favorite author), this constant stream of new information keeps things interesting.

## Outside Work

When I'm not analyzing data or building dashboards, you'll find me reading (I'm so happy I have time for this nowâ€”something I couldn't do in academia), cooking when I have the time to do it properly, or going on long walks with my brown Dalmatian. I have a backlog of personal data science projects I want to tackle, but right now I'm prioritizing books.

## What I Bring

My academic background taught me how to break down complex problems, design experiments, and think rigorously about what evidence actually tells us. My transition to data science has taught me how to move fast, deliver value, and translate technical work into business impact.

I've been working as a data scientist for about five months now, so I'm still relatively early in this career. But I learn quickly, I'm comfortable with ambiguity, and I genuinely enjoy figuring things out. Whether it's wrestling with a tricky LLM integration, designing a new algorithm for synthetic data generation (see my [Italian real estate project](/projects/italian-real-estate/)), or just trying to understand why a specific customer segment behaves the way they do: I'm in my element when I'm solving problems that matter.
