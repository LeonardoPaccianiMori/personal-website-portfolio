# About Me

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at VeryCoolCompany, where I help companies understand their customers and make data-driven marketing decisions. I work on exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, propensity modeling, and econometric analysis.

One recent project: I built an LLM-powered system that integrates multiple data sources to automatically generate audience insights. The key challenge was eliminating hallucinations for client-facing workâ€”the solution delivers accurate, automated insights that received overwhelmingly positive feedback.

Before joining VeryCoolCompany, I spent years in academic research studying biophysics, focusing on bacterial ecology and physiology. I worked at UC San Diego and Harvard, publishing research and developing machine learning algorithms for biological data. While I loved the intellectual challenge, I realized I needed to work on problems with tangible impact. In academia, you can spend years on a single question with no guarantee of finding an answer. I wanted to build things that matter to people.

My academic background taught me how to break down complex problems, design experiments, and think rigorously about evidence. My transition to data science has taught me how to move fast, deliver value, and translate technical work into business impact.

When I'm not analyzing data or building dashboards, you'll find me reading (Italo Calvino is my favorite author), cooking when I have time to do it properly, or going on long walks with my brown Dalmatian Bruno.
